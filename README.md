This is an unsorted collection of stuff I made for the BPhO computational physics challenge, using raylib for visualisation of an orrery and plotly for graphs, with an online version hosted at https://smalljaguar.github.io/bpho_challenge_stuff/. 
There are still some bugs in the code, especially around correctly visualising inclinations or varying timesteps, and lots of it is more messy than I'd like, so I might try and fix it in the future, but no promises.
Building the standalone raylib version has been tested under debian and WSL, and should only require pthreads.
Building for web requires installation of emsdk. Feel free to ask me if you have any questions about the code or building it!
